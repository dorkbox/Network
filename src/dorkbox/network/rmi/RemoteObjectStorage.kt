/**
 * This class allows you to store objects in it via an ID.
 *
 *
 * The ID can be reserved ahead of time, or it can be dynamically generated. Additionally, this class will recycle IDs, and prevent
 * reserved IDs from being dynamically selected.
 *
 * ADDITIONALLY, these IDs are limited to SHORT size (65535 max value) because when executing remote methods, a lot, it is important to
 * have as little data overhead in the message as possible.
 *
 * These data structures are not SHORTs because the JVM doesn't have good support for SHORT.
 *
 * From https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/jvms8.pdf
 *
 * The Java Virtual Machine provides the most direct support for data of type int. This is partly in anticipation of efficient
 * implementations of the Java Virtual Machine's operand stacks and local variable arrays. It is also motivated by the frequency of
 * int data in typical programs. Other integral types have less direct support. There are no byte, char, or short versions of the
 * store, load, or add instructions, for instance.
 *
 *
 * In situations where we want to pass in the Connection (to an RMI method) as a parameter, we have to be able to override method A,
 * with method B.
 *
 * This is to support calling RMI methods from an interface (that does pass the connection reference) to an implType, that DOES pass
 * the connection reference. The remote side (that initiates the RMI calls), MUST use the interface, and the implType may override
 * the method, so that we add the connection as the first in the list of parameters.
 *
 *
 * for example:
 * Interface: foo(String x)
 * Impl: foo(Connection c, String x)
 *
 *
 * The implType (if it exists, with the same name, and with the same signature + connection parameter) will be called from the interface
 * instead of the method that would NORMALLY be called.
