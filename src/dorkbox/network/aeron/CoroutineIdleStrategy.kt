/**
 * Idle strategy for use by threads when they do not have work to do.
 *
 *
 * **Note regarding implementor state**
 *
 *
 * Some implementations are known to be stateful, please note that you cannot safely assume implementations to be
 * stateless. Where implementations are stateful it is recommended that implementation state is padded to avoid false
 * sharing.
 *
 *
 * **Note regarding potential for TTSP(Time To Safe Point) issues**
 *
 *
 * If the caller spins in a 'counted' loop, and the implementation does not include a a safepoint poll this may cause a
 * TTSP (Time To SafePoint) problem. If this is the case for your application you can solve it by preventing the idle
 * method from being inlined by using a Hotspot compiler command as a JVM argument e.g:
 * `-XX:CompileCommand=dontinline,org.agrona.concurrent.NoOpIdleStrategy::idle`

     * <li>'work' returns a value larger than 0 when some work has been done</li>
     * <li>'work' returns 0 when no work has been done</li>
