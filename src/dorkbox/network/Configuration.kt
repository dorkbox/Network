     * There are three main Agents in the driver:
     * - Conductor: Responsible for reacting to client requests and house keeping duties as well as detecting loss, sending NAKs,
     * rotating buffers, etc.
     * - Sender: Responsible for shovelling messages from publishers to the network.
     * - Receiver: Responsible for shovelling messages from the network to subscribers.
     *
     *
     * This value can be one of:
     * - INVOKER: No threads. The client is responsible for using the MediaDriver.Context.driverAgentInvoker() to invoke the duty
     * cycle directly.
     * - SHARED: All Agents share a single thread. 1 thread in total.
     * - SHARED_NETWORK: Sender and Receiver shares a thread, conductor has its own thread. 2 threads in total.
     * - DEDICATED: The default and dedicates one thread per Agent. 3 threads in total.
     *
     *
     * For performance, it is recommended to use DEDICATED as long as the number of busy threads is less than or equal to the number of
     * spare cores on the machine. If there are not enough cores to dedicate, then it is recommended to consider sharing some with
     * SHARED_NETWORK or SHARED. INVOKER can be used for low resource environments while the application using Aeron can invoke the
     * media driver to carry out its duty cycle on a regular interval.

     * (> 4KB) messages and for maximizing throughput above everything else. Various checks during publication and subscription/connection
     * setup are done to verify a decent relationship with MTU.
     *
     *
     * However, it is good to understand these relationships.
     *
     *
     * The MTU on the Media Driver controls the length of the MTU of data frames. This value is communicated to the Aeron clients during
     * registration. So, applications do not have to concern themselves with the MTU value used by the Media Driver and use the same value.
     *
     *
     * An MTU value over the interface MTU will cause IP to fragment the datagram. This may increase the likelihood of loss under several
     * circumstances. If increasing the MTU over the interface MTU, consider various ways to increase the interface MTU first in preparation.
     *
     *
     * The MTU value indicates the largest message that Aeron will send as a single data frame.
     *

     * MTU length also has implications for socket buffer sizing.
