/**
 * This is to manage serializing RMI objects across the wire...
 *
 * NOTE:
 *   CLIENT: can never send the iface object, if it's RMI, it will send the java Proxy object instead.
 *   SERVER: can never send the iface object, it will always send the IMPL object instead (because of how kryo works)
 *
 *   **************************
 *   NOTE: This works because we TRICK kryo serialization by changing what the kryo ID serializer is on each end of the connection
 *   **************************
 *
 *   What we do is on the server, REWRITE the kryo ID for the impl so that it will send just the rmi ID instead of the object
 *   on the client, this SAME kryo ID must have this serializer as well, so the proxy object is re-assembled.
 *
 *   Kryo serialization works by inspecting the field VALUE type, not the field DEFINED type... So if you send an actual object, you must
 *   register specifically for the implementation object.
 *
 *
 * To recap:
 *  rmi-client: send proxy -> RmiIfaceSerializer -> network -> RmiIfaceSerializer -> impl object (rmi-server)
 *  rmi-server: send impl -> RmiImplSerializer -> network -> RmiImplSerializer -> proxy object (rmi-client)
 *
 *  rmi-server MUST registerRmi both the iface+impl
 *
 *  During the handshake, if the impl object 'lives' on the CLIENT, then the client must tell the server that the iface ID must use this serializer.
 *  If the impl object 'lives' on the SERVER, then the server must tell the client about the iface ID

     * In general:
     *
     *  ALL kryo registrations must be for IMPL, because of how kryo works, kryo can ONLY send IMPL objects, and thus serialization
     *  can only be for IMPL objects. (we can write fields for an IFACE, but when constructing an object, it must be concrete)
     *
     * To recap how RMI works:
     *   rmi-client works ONLY with proxy objects
     *   rmi-server works ONLY with impl objects
