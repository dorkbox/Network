Network
=======

The Network project is an encrypted, high-performance, event-driven/reactive Network stack with DNS and RMI, using Netty, Kryo, KryoNet RMI, and LZ4 via TCP/UDP/UDT. 

These are the main features:
- The connection between endpoints is AES256-GCM / EC curve25519.
- The connection data is LZ4 compressed and byte-packed for small payload sizes.
- The connection supports:
 - Remote Method Invocation
   - Blocking
   - Non-Blocking
   - Void returns
   - Exceptions can be returned
 - Sending data when Idle
 - "Pinging" the remote end (for measuring round-trip time)
 

- The available transports are TCP, UDP, and UDT
- There are simple wrapper classes for:
  - Server
  - Client
  - DNS Client (for querying DNS servers)
  - MultiCast Broadcast client and server discovery
  

- Note: There is a maximum packet size for UDP, 508 bytes *to guarantee it's unfragmented*

- This is for cross-platform use, specifically - linux 32/64, mac 32/64, and windows 32/64. Java 6+
    - Please note that Java6 runtimes have issues with their classloader loading classes recursively (you will get a StackOverflow exception). We have taken precautions to mitigate this, but be aware that it is a very real possibility. We recommend using Java7+ to prevent this issue.

``` java
public static
class AMessage {
    public
    AMessage() {
    }
}

KryoCryptoSerializationManager.DEFAULT.register(AMessage.class);

Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
configuration.tcpPort = tcpPort;
configuration.host = host;

final Server server = new Server(configuration);
addEndPoint(server);
server.bind(false);

server.listeners()
      .add(new Listener<AMessage>() {
          @Override
          public
          void received(Connection connection, AMessage object) {
              System.err.println("Server received message from client. Bouncing back.");
              connection.send()
                        .TCP(object);
          }
      });

Client client = new Client(configuration);
client.disableRemoteKeyValidation();
addEndPoint(client);
client.connect(5000);

client.listeners()
      .add(new Listener<AMessage>() {
          @Override
          public
          void received(Connection connection, AMessage object) {
              ClientSendTest.this.checkPassed.set(true);
              System.err.println("Tada! It's been bounced back.");
              server.stop();
          }
      });

client.send()
      .TCP(new AMessage());

```

Release Notes 
---------

This project includes some utility classes that are a small subset of a much larger library. These classes are **kept in sync** with the main utilities library, so "jar hell" is not an issue, and the latest release will always include the same version of utility files as all of the other projects in the dorkbox repository at that time. 
  
  Please note that the utility source code is included in the release and on our [GitHub](https://github.com/dorkbox/Utilities) repository.
